##Bisecting k-Means
It is like a combination of k-Means and hierarchical clustering. It starts with all objects in a single cluster.

The critical part is which cluster to choose for splitting. And there are different ways to proceed, for example, you can choose the biggest cluster or the cluster with the worst quality or a combination of both.

This folder contains a file bkmeans.R containing the code for bisecting k-means.
